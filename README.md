# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project
## Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

Data science and analysis skills play important roles in providing insights from the Nigerian COVID-19 metrics such as : 
*	How the states rank in terms of total confirmed cases, total recovered cases, total death cases, the percentage of the confirmed cases that died as a result of the pandemic in the states?
*	When were the highest infection rate recorded, maximum daily infection rate (plus the date it was recorded)?
*	Is there a linear relationship between number of cases recorded and population density?
*	What alarming factors could enhance the impact of the pandemic in each state?
*	How can governments, donors, organizations, and companies allocate resources effectively? How more targeted, sector-specific interventions would mitigate the impact of the pandemic in these states?
*	Which state is the most vulnerable?
*	Did the outbreak have effect on Nigeriaâ€™s economy?


This project aims to use data science & analytic skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

Steps/Approaches:
